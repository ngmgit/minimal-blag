### This blog and me :

Hello! I am Nishanth, a frontend developer from India and my day to day job primarily involves working with reactjs based webapps. The primary motivation to write this blog is to document my journey and experience so that I can revisit the concepts and also help others who are in the same boat as me.

Apart from frontend I am also interested in game development/graphics programming. And have worked on few toy projects in Unity3D. And recently I bought an Oculus Quest 2 in the hopes of catching up with this exciting new platform. So you can expect some posts related to this.

- I am learning to play guitar and am past the beginner barrier.
- And actively learning music theory via information available online.
- I like to play games from a wide variety of genres and same applies to anime or music.
- I also like to cook ~~and I want to add that, the only food I can cook without the supervision of an adult, my egg dish is very tasty IMO. So there you go I can cook a tasty omlette.~~ I have cooked a variety of dishes by now and I like to experiment more on this on weekends.

Hope you find this blog useful. Thank you for reading my posts!
